# client authentication
# in general, there are two cases:
#  - if you want to emulate the client, set your steamid and magic_hash
#  - if you want to run a server, set them empty - this is important.
#     In case you set them non-empty, run the server and database goes down, these
#     credentials will be used for other players - thus sending wrong data about 
#     your account
#
#  you can also set them to yours, enable PROXY_ALL (or add commands into PROXY_ALWAYS)
#  and run server locally to capture commands for debugging
